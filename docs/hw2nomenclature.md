## 2) Objectives

- **General:** To develop the ability to solve problems involving rotation and transformation of vectors and coordinate systems by formulating the appropriate rotation and homogeneous transformation matrices, and understanding the relationship between different reference frames through these transformations.

## 3) First Excercise
- **Explanation:** In this exercise, the objective is to rotate a vector named P about two different axes. First, the vector is rotated around the Y axis of frame A by an angle of forty five degrees. Then, it is rotated around the X axis of frame A by an angle of sixty degrees. The goal is to determine the rotation matrix that performs both rotations in the specified order.

## 4) Second Excercise
- **Explanation:** This exercise involves both rotation and translation between coordinate frames. The reference frame B is rotated with respect to reference frame A around the X axis of frame A by thirty degrees. In addition, the translation of frame B relative to frame A is given by a vector with components five and ten.
