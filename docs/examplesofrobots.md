## 1) Resumen

- **Nombre del proyecto:** Examples Of Robots By Morphology  
- **Equipo / Autor(es):** Angel Ivan Dominguez Cruz

## 2) Objetivos

- **General:** Analyze and compare different industrial robot morphologies by examining thir kinematic structures, degrees of freedom and resulting workspaces.

## 3) Robots By Morphologies

- **Catesian Robot:** These robots operate on three axes (X, Y and Z) at 90 degree angles to each other. This structure allows the to cover a rectangular or cubical workspace. An example could be the TPA-E Series Gantry Robot from MAcron Dynamics. These robots are used for automated material handling (carrying heavy things) or assembling large components.
- **Cylindrical Robot:** These robots have a rotary base, a vertical linear axis and a horizontal linear axis. These robots create a cylindrical workspace. A real life example is the Motoman L3. These type of robots are less common today, but they are used for simple pick and place operations, machine tending and assembly tasks.
- **Polar Robot:** These robots have a rotary base, a rotary shoulder joint and a linear axis to extend and retract the arm. The workspace of these robots is a sphere. The Unimate (the first industrial robot) is the most famous example and it was used by General Motors in the 1960s for spot welding and die-casting.
- **Jointed-Arm Robot:** These robots have a rotary base, a vertical linear axis and a horizontal linear axis. These robots create a cylindrical workspace. A real life example is the Motoman L3. These type of robots are less common today, but they are used for simple pick and place operations, machine tending and assembly tasks.
